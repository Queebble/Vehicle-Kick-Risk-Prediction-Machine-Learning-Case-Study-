# Vehicle-Kick-Risk-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Case-Study-
Built an end-to-end ML workflow to predict high-risk vehicle purchases (“kicks”) using a 40k-row dataset. Performed data cleaning, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning across Decision Tree, Regression, and Neural Network models, identifying key predictors and recommending the best performing model.
